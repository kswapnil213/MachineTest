Task:- 

To create a functional UI Design as shown in the screenshots below and integrate a REST API to display data from the server.


Expected UI Behavior:- 

1.	The left side of the screen will feature Level One categories of products available.
2.	Tapping on any category on the left side of the screen will produce Level Two List of Categories on the right side.
3.	Level two categories will be displayed in the form of expandable and collapsible sections.
4.	At any given time, only one Level Two section can be expandable. If the user taps on any other section, any previously expanded section should close.
5.	Every expanded section will contain a Level Three section which will be the list of products available.
6.	The search bar on top should filter through Level three of objects (for eg. Eyewear accessories, womenâ€™s sunglasses, etc).
